I am currently pursuing my undergraduate studies in B.E. Computer Science at [BITS Pilani - Pilani Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), where I am in my second year. My areas of interest include, inter alia, mathematics, theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence and parliamentary debate, though this may change in future.    
<br/>
Beyond the classroom, I am actively involved with the [Mathematics Association](https://maths-assoc-bits-pilani.github.io/), where I served as a **Oasis (Fest) Joint Coordinator (2025-26)** and I am a **Research Team Member (2024-Present)**.  I'm a **Physics Association Member (2024-Present)**, **BITS Pilani Debsoc Member (2024-Present)**, and **Carrom Team Member (2024-Present)** as well. Outside my extracurricular work, I enjoy reading progression fantasy and playing chess.
